## Skills & Expertise

My career journey has provided a unique blend of skills. I excel at creating functional and visually appealing websites, primarily using WordPress and tools like Elementor, DiviBuilder, and WP Bakery. I've managed over 60 websites and possess a strong understanding of SEO, copywriting, and the WPMUDev ecosystem.

Beyond web design, I'm passionate about visual storytelling through photography and videography. My film studies background allows me to handle fast-paced DSLR shoots for corporate events, weddings, and outdoor events. I particularly enjoy capturing the energy of golf events and showcasing products with precision. I've also produced and edited highlight reels for a digital online magazine.

My IT troubleshooting and problem-solving skills stem from experience in server administration and service desk roles. I thrive on tackling complex technical issues and finding effective solutions.
